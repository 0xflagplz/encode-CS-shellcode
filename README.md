[Shellcode Generation Aggressor Script](https://github.com/RCStep/CSSG)

## What it Does:
XOR's the .RAW or .BIN with a key   
Formats Output for C++  

## Recommondation - Pipe Output Into File (Large Output)      
> sudo apt update   
> sudo apt install python-pip   
> pip2 install -r requirements.txt   
> python2.7 encode-CS-shellcode.py beacon-test.raw 123 > test.txt      


## Output
```
char key[] = "123";
char encryptedShellcode[] =
